## Description

Xetz-Up is a simple yet captivating arcade game developed in Python. Inspired by the classic arcade game "Space Invaders," Xetz-Up challenges players to defend their base by shooting down waves of descending enemies. The gameplay is designed to be engaging and enjoyable, offering a nostalgic arcade experience with modern programming techniques.

This project was instrumental in deepening my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Through the development of Xetz-Up, I learned how to structure a program into classes and objects, manage game states, handle user input, and render graphics using a game development library. This project prooved me how programming can be incredibly fun!
